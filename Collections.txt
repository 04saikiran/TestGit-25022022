1.The list implementation allows us to add the same or duplicate elements. 1)The set implementation doesn't allow us to add the same or duplicate elements.
2.The insertion order is maintained by the List.	                   2)It doesn't maintain the insertion order of elements.
3.List allows us to add any number of null values.	                   3)Set allows us to add at least one null value in it.
4.The List implementation classes are LinkedList and ArrayList.	           4)The Set implementation classes are TreeSet, HashSet and LinkedHashSet.
5.We can get the element of a specified index from the list using the      5)We cannot find the element from the Set based on the index 
                                                                                because it doesn't provide any get method().get() method.	                                                        
6.It is used when we want to frequently access the elements                6)It is used when we want to design a collection of distinct elements.
by using the index.	
7.The method of List interface listiterator() is used to iterate the List 7)The iterator is used when we need to iterate the Set elements.
elements.

# Array List & Linked List

1) ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements.	    1)LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.
2) Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses an array. 2)Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory.
   If any element is removed from the array, all the bits are shifted in memory.
3) An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List     3)LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.
4) ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.	                    4)LinkedList is better for manipulating data.

#Hashmap & Hashset

1)HashMap is a hash table based implementation of Map interface.                   1)HashSet is a Set. It creates a collection that uses a hash table for storage.
2)HashMap we store a key-value pair. It maintains the mapping of key and value.    2)In HashSet, we store objects.
3)It does not allow duplicate keys, but duplicate values are allowed.              3)It does not allow duplicate values.
4)It can contain a single null key and multiple null values.                       4)It can contain a single null value.
5)HashMap is faster than HashSet because values are associated with a unique key.  5)HashSet is slower than HashMap because the member object is used for calculating hashcode value, which can be same for two objects.
